These tools can be used to extract ML library APIs from the projects.

     1. The script (main_collect_ML_APIs_AST.py ) iterates all the given projects and extract all the ML library package names 
     2. The script (main_collect_ml_api_type_Inference.py) collects all the ML library APIs together with the ML API usage in references of ML constructs. 
     
**Usage**: 
       
     1. main_collect_ML_APIs_AST.py <the folder to download projects> <csv file with projects>
     2. main_collect_ml_api_type_Inference.py <the folder to download projects> <csv file with projects>
