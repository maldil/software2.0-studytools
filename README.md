# Software 2.0 - Study tools
This repository gives all the tools that used in the study **Understanding Software-2.0: A Study of Machine Learning library usage and evolution**

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required dependent libraries.

1. The tools in [DetectingMLLibraries](https://github.com/maldil/software2.0-studytools/tree/master/DetectingMLLibraries) generate statistics on the usage of ML libraries. You can also generate a csv file with ML libraries used in each project. You can use it to generate associate rules from the [script](https://github.com/maldil/software2.0-studytools/tree/master/FPGrowth)  
2. The tools in [MLLibraryUpdateAnalysis](https://github.com/maldil/software2.0-studytools/tree/master/MLLibraryUpdateAnalysis) generate statistics of ML library updates. It also generates a csv file with all the cascade library updates. You can use it to generate associate rules from the [script](https://github.com/maldil/software2.0-studytools/tree/master/FPGrowth) 
3. The tools in [AnalyseMLLibConstructs](https://github.com/maldil/software2.0-studytools/tree/master/AnalyseMLLibConstructs) collects all the ML library APIs used in the projects.
